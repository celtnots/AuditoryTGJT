# ReactionTimeTester


Zekee:

The paths for the test sounds (line 426 of L1.html, currently "audiopaths = "TestSounds/") will need to be updated. The sentences are in the JSON file, with path: "Testsetrecordings/testsetL1/example 1.mp3" etc. The path to that JSON file will need to be updated (line 444 of L1.html).

The DB connection worked on localhost and on the floatingcrowbar server. "response.php" just needs to be in the same folder, or have its path (line 403 of L1.html) updated.

I didn't add a path for the images (testsound0001.png, incorrect0001.png, etc. so if these go into a "static" folder, they'll need new paths.

Other than that, feel free to change anything that looks inefficient, etc.

THANK YOU!!!!!!!!
